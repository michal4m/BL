I am a data analyst with practical experience in supply chain. I enjoy understanding, optimizing and automating processes. I believe in simplicity rather than complexity and try to learn new things whenever it is possible. Besides that, I try to follow the startups environment looking for fresh business ideas.  

If you would like to work with me on any project related to data science or one of my hobbies please feel free to contact me.
